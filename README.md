Executive Summary: Ferns and Petals (FNP) Sales Analysis Dashboard Project

The Ferns and Petals (FNP) Sales Analysis project is an end-to-end data analysis and visualization exercise designed to extract actionable business insights from a transactional dataset. The dataset comprises detailed information on products, orders, customers, and relevant dates, covering multiple occasions such as Diwali, Raksha Bandhan, Holi, Valentine's Day, Birthdays, and Anniversaries. The primary objective of this project is to analyze sales trends, understand customer behavior, evaluate product performance, and provide strategic insights to improve revenue and optimize customer satisfaction.

The project follows a structured workflow, beginning with data extraction and cleaning using Power Query Editor. This step involved transforming raw data into a consistent format, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for advanced analytics. Following the cleaning phase, data modeling was performed in Power Pivot, creating relationships between tables, defining measures, and preparing the dataset for pivot analysis.

The analysis phase utilized Pivot Tables and DAX measures to address key business questions, including:

Total Revenue: Calculated overall revenue to establish a benchmark for sales performance.

Average Order and Delivery Time: Evaluated operational efficiency by determining the average time taken for order delivery.

Monthly Sales Performance: Analyzed fluctuations in sales across each month of 2023 to identify peak seasons and trends.

Top Products by Revenue: Identified high-revenue products to inform inventory and marketing priorities.

Customer Spending Analysis: Assessed average spending per customer to understand purchasing patterns.

Sales Performance of Top 5 Products: Tracked performance trends of the most significant revenue-generating products.

Top 10 Cities by Number of Orders: Pinpointed regions with the highest order volumes to guide geographic marketing strategies.

Order Quantity vs. Delivery Time: Investigated whether larger orders affect delivery efficiency, highlighting operational bottlenecks.

Revenue Comparison Between Occasions: Compared revenue contributions from different occasions to inform seasonal promotions and campaigns.

Product Popularity by Occasion: Identified which products were most popular during specific occasions to optimize product assortment.

The culmination of this analysis is a comprehensive interactive dashboard built entirely in Excel. The dashboard integrates KPIs, charts, and slicers to provide dynamic insights, enabling decision-makers to drill down into specific trends, product performance, and customer behavior. This visualization offers a single source of truth for monitoring sales performance, guiding strategic decisions, and driving business growth for Ferns and Petals.

By leveraging Excelâ€™s Power Query, Power Pivot, and advanced Pivot Table functionalities, this project demonstrates the ability to transform raw transactional data into meaningful business intelligence, providing a scalable framework for ongoing sales analysis and reporting.
